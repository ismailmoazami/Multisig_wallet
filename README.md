# MultiSigWallet

This is a MultiSigWallet written in Solidity. It is a smart contract that requires a certain number of approvals from a group of owners before a transaction can be executed. The number of required approvals and the list of owners can be set during contract deployment.

## Features

- Deposit: Allows users to deposit funds into the wallet.
- Submit: Allows owners to submit a transaction.
- Approve: Allows owners to approve a transaction.
- Revoke: Allows owners to revoke their approval for a transaction.
- Execute: Allows owners to execute a transaction if it has enough approvals.

## Usage

To use this contract, you need to deploy it on the Ethereum network. You can do this by compiling the `DeployMultiSigWallet.s.sol` script and running it on a local or test Ethereum network. The script will return the address of the deployed MultiSigWallet.

Once the MultiSigWallet is deployed, you can interact with it using a web3 provider like MetaMask or a tool like Remix. You can deposit funds, submit transactions, approve or revoke approvals, and execute transactions.

## Security

The MultiSigWallet is designed to be secure, but it is always important to review the code and test it thoroughly before using it in a production environment. It is also recommended to use a hardware wallet or a secure multi-signature solution for managing large amounts of funds.
